1. Discovering entrypoints

We could have used:
 - Fixed URI (/restaurants)
   - robots.txt
      "has a list of restaurants at /restaurants"
 - Homepage with links
   - service document in AtomPub
      "has an atompub service doc at /services, find collection with name restaurants
   - html page
      "has to be html, have an <a> element with rel="restaurants"

To discover the various entrypoints into the application, an agent 
MAY send a request to any resource URI on a target server and read 
the link headers[1] that MUST be present on the response.

The rest-aurant specification provides the following link relationships
that can be discovered.
|| Title               | Rel value                              ||
 | List of restaurants | http://rest.aurant.org/restaurant-list |
